Hi! I am Hugo Aguirre, and this is my blog. 
<!--more-->

Not my first blog, though. I have tried many times having a blog but I really never found the motivation to keep writing. So, what's different this time? Not much really. I just think that a blog is not about how frequent are the post, but about how relevant are the posts in it. So instead of making a goal of mine writing at least once a week or some stuff like that, I'll write whenever there is something relevant to write about. It may take months, or maybe just a couple of days. That is not the point really. 

## So, who is writing?

I'm Hugo. I have been developing software since 2009, when I started coding _profesionally_ on ActionScript 3.0 (Yeah, flash). I started coding as a hobby and as school assignments a bit earlier, but nothing serious, aside some final projects made on Visual Basic 6.0 and that kind of stuff.

Right now I consider myself a full stack software developer, engineer and craftsman. In this years I have worked with a bunch of technologies, languages, platforms and frameworks. I have worked mostly in backend, but also in frontend, mobile and videogames. Aside from coding, I also do a fair amount of sysadmin and a lot of project management.

## Neat, so what will you write about?

Mostly about projects good enough to be written about. Projects that are big enough, non-trivial, and not behind an NDA. This means they may not be that much, but anyways. So this will be a kind of a portfolio / blog mashup.

So, thank you for reading!
