Hi! I am **Hugo Aguirre**, and this is my blog. 
<!--more-->

I am a **full stack software developer, engineer and craftsman** from Puebla, Mexico. I love finding solutions to problems and making tools to make these problems easier. Technology is the best asset for this, and coding is like having super powers. That is why I do not limit myself to a single coding skill. I code for backend, frontend, mobile, desktop, servers, embedded devices, databases and even videogames. Aside coding, I am also a Software Engineer, so it is often my responsibility managing technical projects, choosing the best stack for each of them, defining standards for the team, and ensuring the quality of everything that is done.

I have been developing software since 2009, when I started coding _profesionally_ on ActionScript 3.0 (yeah, Flash) on my old Presario 2200. I started coding as a hobby and as school assignments a bit earlier, but nothing serious aside some projects made on Visual Basic 6.0.

Outside software, I enjoy videogames a lot. Pok√©mon is of my favorite games as you may have noticed. I also like to read about epistemology. Ultimately, developing software is also a matter of understanding knowledge.

Somethimes I go as _bool_ or _bul_, you can call me that. Hugo is fine too. Thank you for visiting my site. I hope you find something interesting.
